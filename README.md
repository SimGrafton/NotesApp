-- To do --


5-feature. Adding and saving new category.

Get rid of code section, just have info section but allow to display code section so that I can move it. Have alert.
There should be features at the top of the page, for edit, add picture, add code, add new, delete category.


3-feature. Adding more features to text. So should be able to read code and info, but then should have other boxes
Each FinalCategory should have
{
    orderNum: 1,
    mainText: ""
}

but then can add any of the following. Each can then have it's own way of adding. Can then add more here as well. Have 
these options display on page and on right click.

{
    paragraph: " ",
    header: "",
    image: " ",
    code: " ",
    link: " "
}

4-feature. Editing text
7-feature. Format the return values so that it looks like a blog page.

1-bug. When you click the menu on the bottom entries, it opens up out of clickable range, need to check if its on
screen and if not then position it higher up. Would be useful to have the position of the window size anyway. 

Future:
1. Enable pictures to be included.
