Moved the headers to left-align. Change the categories to display faded and vertically. Changed the font of the title.
"

Next job =: 

Sort backups
1-bug. There seems to be an issue with adding a category name with a period in it. 
1-feature. Allow multiple notes files. And so you can select which one from inside the application. Can you save the
users information and which document they had open last? Even which page?

 

Future:
2. Enable reorganise of content?
3. Enable bold, italics, underline?
4. Enable dark mode?
5. Have this as a module that can be used in other products. So can have this as a tab in Trading app.
