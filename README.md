Current job
2-feature. Create new notes file. Delete notes file.



commit 
"Added button next to file tabs to add a new file. Added a context menu to the tabs so that you can delete a file."


Next job =: 

Test for a while
Publish as app
Sort backups - have put one in onedrive
1-bug. Sometimes the delete category button is unresponsive.
1-improvement. Add proper button icons for all the context menu options. 

Future:
1. Enable dark mode
2. Enable status section. This will show yellow when doing something and will have a dropdown that shows more details.
Green then when everything is a okay. Or could be like a loading symbol. 
2. Enable reorganise of content?
3. Enable bold, italics, underline?
4. Enable dark mode?
5. Have this as a module that can be used in other products. So can have this as a tab in Trading app.
So there should be a main app, which is just the electron. Then you can add modules, which is essentially just
adding an index page. For this to work, the modules would have to not clash.
6. Publish as app
7. Output section as word file. Output entirety as pdf or word file.
