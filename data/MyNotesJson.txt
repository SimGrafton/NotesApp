For objects that are declared as const , you can only call constant member functions. This ensures that the constant object is never modified.\r\n\r\nIn C++, you can use the const keyword instead of the #define preprocessor directive to define constant values. Values defined with const are subject to type checking, and can be used in place of constant expressions. \r\n\r\nConstexpr vs Const:\r\nConstexpr is used during compile time. This means that when you use constexpr to define some constant primitive value, you suggest that this symbol will be used in a constexpr function. If you're using a constant primitive value that is not used in any constexpr functions, use standard const, so that after quick glance over a symbol, reviewer will know that there is no constexpr function used with this particular symbol. Constexpr is a tool built for specific purposes, and while it fits in some of the cases where simple const would work, it shouldn\u0019t be used interchangeably.\r\n\r\n\u0000","Code":"\u0000"},"Constexpr":{"Info":"Constexpr:\r\nconst applies for variables, and prevents them from being modified in your code.\r\n\r\nconstexpr tells the compiler that this expression results in a compile time constant value, so it can be used in places like array lengths, assigning to const variables, etc. The link given by Oli has a lot of excellent examples.\r\n\r\nThe keyword constexpr was introduced in C++11 and improved in C++14. It means constant expression. Like const, it can be applied to variables: A compiler error is raised when any code attempts to modify the value. Unlike const, constexpr can also be applied to functions and class constructors. constexpr indicates that the value, or return value, is constant and, where possible, is computed at compile time.\r\n\r\nA constexpr integral value can be used wherever a const integer is required, such as in template arguments and array declarations. And when a value is computed at compile time instead of run time, it helps your program run faster and use less memory.\r\n\r\nTo limit the complexity of compile-time constant computations, and their potential impacts on compilation time, the C++14 standard requires the types in constant expressions to be literal types.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nIncreases runtime efficiency by moving things from runtime to compile time\r\nSImplify code through compile time computation\r\n\r\nSo, why do we need constexpr?\r\nThe primary usage of constexpr is to declare intent.\r\n\r\nIf an entity isn't marked as constexpr - it was never intended to be used in a constant-expression; and even if it is, we rely on the compiler to diagnose such context (because it disregards our intent).\r\n\r\n\u0000","Code":"Suppose it does something a little more complicated.\r\n\r\nconstexpr int MeaningOfLife ( int a, int b ) { return a * b; }\r\n\r\nconst int meaningOfLife = MeaningOfLife( 6, 7 );\r\n\r\nNow you have something that can be evaluated down to a constant while maintaining good readability and allowing slightly more complex processing than just setting a constant to a number.\r\n\r\nIt basically provides a good aid to maintainability as it becomes more obvious what you are doing. Take max( a, b ) for example:\r\n\r\ntemplate< typename Type > constexpr Type max( Type a, Type b ) { return a < b ? b : a; }\r\n\r\nIts a pretty simple choice there but it does mean that if you call max with constant values it is explicitly calculated at compile time and not at runtime.\r\n\r\nAnother good example would be a DegreesToRadians function.

Most integral fundamental types (except bool, double, wchar_t, and related types) all have unsigned versions, which modify the range of values that the variable can store. For example, an int, which stores a 32-bit signed integer, can represent a value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. An unsigned int, which is also stored as 32-bits, can store a value from 0 to 4,294,967,295.

In a function declaration, a void return value means that the function does not return a value; this is a common and acceptable use of void.

A pointer type stores the address of the location in memory where the actual data value is stored. \r\n\r\nIn modern C++, these are referred to as raw pointers, and are accessed in your code through special operators * (asterisk) or -> (dash with greater-than). This is called dereferencing, and which one that you use depends on whether you are dereferencing a pointer to a scalar or a pointer to a member in an object. Working with pointer types has long been one of the most challenging and confusing aspects of C and C++ program development. This section outlines some facts and practices to help use raw pointers if you want to, but in modern C++ it\u0019s no longer required (or recommended) to use raw pointers for object ownership at all, due to the evolution of the smart pointer (discussed more at the end of this section). It is still useful and safe to use raw pointers for observing objects, but if you must use them for object ownership, you should do so with caution and very careful consideration of how the objects owned by them are created and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe corrected code example uses local stack memory to create the backing store that pNumber points to. We use a fundamental type for simplicity. In practice, the backing store for pointers are most often user-defined types that are dynamically-allocated in an area of memory called the heap (or free store) by using a new keyword expression (in C-style programming, the older malloc() C runtime library function was used). Once allocated, these variables are usually referred to as objects, especially if they are based on a class definition. Memory that is allocated with new must be deleted by a corresponding delete statement (or, if you used the malloc() function to allocate it, the C runtime function free()).\r\n\r\nHowever, it is easy to forget to delete a dynamically-allocated object- especially in complex code, which causes a resource bug called a memory leak. For this reason, the use of raw pointers is strongly discouraged in modern C++. It is almost always better to wrap a raw pointer in a smart pointer, which will automatically release the memory when its destructor is invoked (when the code goes out of scope for the smart pointer); by using smart pointers you virtually eliminate a whole class of bugs in your C++ programs. In the following example, assume MyClass is a user-defined type that has a public method DoSomeWork();\r\n\r\nThe first thing that you should know is declaring a raw pointer variable will allocate only the memory that is required to store an address of the memory location that the pointer will be referring to when it is dereferenced. Allocation of the memory for the data value itself (also called backing store) is not yet allocated. In other words, by declaring a raw pointer variable, you are creating a memory address variable, not an actual data variable. Dereferencing a pointer variable before making sure that it contains a valid address to a backing store will cause undefined behavior (usually a fatal error) in your program. The following example demonstrates this kind of error:\u0000","Code":"    int number = 10;          // Declare and initialize a local integer\r\n                              // variable for data backing store.\r\n    int* pNumber = &number;   // Declare and initialize a local integer\r\n                              // pointer variable to a valid memory\r\n                              // address to that backing store.\r\n...\r\n    *pNumber = 41;            // Dereference and store a new value in\r\n                              // the memory pointed to by\r\n                              // pNumber, the integer variable called\r\n                              // \"number\".

A character encoding is used in computation, data storage, and transmission of textual data. \"Character set\", \"character map\", \"codeset\" and \"code page\" are related, but not identical, terms.\r\n\r\nEarly character codes associated with the optical or electrical telegraph could only represent a subset of the characters used in written languages, sometimes restricted to upper case letters, numerals and some punctuation only. The low cost of digital representation of data in modern computer systems allows more elaborate character codes (such as Unicode) which represent most of the characters used in many written languages. Character encoding using internationally accepted standards permits worldwide interchange of text in electronic form.\r\n\r\nA code unit is a bit sequence used to encode each character of a repertoire within a given encoding form. This is referred to as a code value in some documents.\u0000","Code":"A code unit in US-ASCII consists of 7 bits;\r\nA code unit in UTF-8, EBCDIC and GB18030 consists of 8 bits;\r\nA code unit in UTF-16 consists of 16 bits;\r\nA code unit in UTF-32 consists of 32 bits.\u0000"},"Unicode":{"Info":"Unicode and its parallel standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set, together constitute a modern, unified character encoding. Rather than mapping characters directly to octets (bytes), they separately define what characters are available, corresponding natural numbers (code points), how those numbers are encoded as a series of fixed-size natural numbers (code units), and finally how those units are encoded as a stream of octets. The purpose of this decomposition is to establish a universal set of characters that can be encoded in a variety of ways.[8] To describe this model correctly requires more precise terms than \"character set\" and \"character encoding.\" The terms used in the modern model follow. \r\n\r\nUTF-8 is the most commonly used encoding scheme used on today's computer systems and computer networks.\r\n\r\nUnicode text can be encoded in various formats: The two most important ones are UTF-8 and UTF-16. In C++ Windows code there's often a need to convert between UTF-8 and UTF-16, because Unicode-enabled Win32 APIs use UTF-16 as their native Unicode encoding.\u0000","Code":"The code unit size is equivalent to the bit measurement for the particular encoding:\r\n\r\nA code unit in US-ASCII consists of 7 bits;\r\nA code unit in UTF-8, EBCDIC and GB18030 consists of 8 bits;\r\nA code unit in UTF-16 consists of 16 bits;\r\nA code unit in UTF-32 consists of 32 bits.\r\nExample of a code unit: Consider a string of the letters \"abc\" followed by U+10400 \u0001\u0000"},"ASCI":{"Info":"ASCII (/  ski / (About this soundlisten) ASS-kee),[3]:\n6\n abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.
